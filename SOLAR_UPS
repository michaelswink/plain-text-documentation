Solar assisted UPS systems can be a viable solution to bringing powered structures to areas without a large power grid. Regions with plentiful sunlight and little development could benefit from these systems in the present, and be easily tied into a grid if and when it is developed. These systems could also lessen the burden of power generation systems in grids which are still developing.
